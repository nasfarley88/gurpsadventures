\subsubsection{The angry boss}
\label{sec:angry-boss}

\paragraph{Basic idea}

Players are told beforehand that something is going to happen and they are going
to have to improv. Whatever they say will be accepted as true (or a lie if they
want). The characters then enter a room where the boss shouts ``What the hell
happened? You killed the wrong guy!'' \emph{Cue improv.}

\paragraph{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item Don't need to know much about the characters
\item Shows people's colours quickly
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cons}

\begin{itemize}
\item Doesn't lead anywhere by default
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The job}
\label{sec:job}

\paragraph{Basic idea}

The team get given a job, Charlie's Angels style: rob a mafia bank. Payout is
given \emph{on delivery} but only a certain amount must be stolen (client's
wishes). If more is stolen the team will be in trouble.

\paragraph{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item \player{Thief} will totally steal more
\item Can split the party to go information searching
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This even means that David and I can find different information and
    combine it (making more improv.\ excellency)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cons}

Will have to prep a building for everyone to get involved in. Basically design
an entire challenge.
