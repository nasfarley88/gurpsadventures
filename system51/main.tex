\label{sec:nanite-wars}

\begin{itemize}

  enough energy to do something
\item Since then, nanites have been banned. Even the bad guy stay away from them
\item This was all 1000~years ago. And people still remember. That's how bad.

\subsubsection{The angry boss}
\label{sec:angry-boss}

\paragraph{Basic idea}

Players are told beforehand that something is going to happen and they are going
to have to improv. Whatever they say will be accepted as true (or a lie if they
want). The characters then enter a room where the boss shouts ``What the hell
happened? You killed the wrong guy!'' \emph{Cue improv.}

\paragraph{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item Don't need to know much about the characters
\item Shows people's colours quickly
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cons}

\begin{itemize}
\item Doesn't lead anywhere by default
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{The job}
\label{sec:job}

\paragraph{Basic idea}

The team get given a job, Charlie's Angels style: rob a mafia bank. Payout is
given \emph{on delivery} but only a certain amount must be stolen (client's
wishes). If more is stolen the team will be in trouble.

\paragraph{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item Matt K will totally steal more
\item 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Cons}

Will have to prep a building for everyone to get involved in. Basically design
an entire challenge.
